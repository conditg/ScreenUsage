Supervised Learning: How different data distributions impact performance of regression methods

In this project, I create a flexible dataset generator. This enables an examination of the core of Statistics for Data Science, including common data distributions and transformations, the Central Limit Theorem, Law of Large Numbers, and how Supervised Learning Models handle non-normal inputs and targets.
