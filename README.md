# Predicting Disruption
## Supervised Learning: predicting behavior patterns of preschool children based on screen habits and demographics. 

[Start with the Overview Here](https://github.com/conditg/predicting-disruption/blob/master/DisruptPDF.pdf)

In this project, I use data collected by a [Deakin University Study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193700) to see if screen time, outdoor time, and other behavioral measures can be used to predict children with a high probability of being disruptive. 

## PCA on binary variables

Also included is a sidebar on Primary Components Analysis of binary variables. A series of visualizations are created with simple, fake data to help data scientists build an intuition around what this does and its benefits and limitations.
